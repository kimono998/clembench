Welcome to my new game! Your task is to move from start to end across the board. I will give you a board with empty fields. An empty field is marked like this □.
Your tokens are marked with X and Y. Your tokens X or Y count as occupied fields. The total number of fields remains unchanged throughout the game! The maximum number of tokens is 2.

General instructions:

0) The game starts with an initial state provided by me. This initial state is a board with all empty fields.
1) Every turn I will give you the current state of the grid. You must tell me what your next move is.
2) Your answers must contain the words "MY MOVE:", the instruction of how you want the token to move.
3) You must keep track of the state of the board in order to win the game.
4) You cannot have 2 tokens in the same field.
5) You can only move one token in 1 round.
6) Always take a deep breath, and solve the problem step by step. I need to see you solve the problem.
7) Always provide your reasoning first. After you provide your reasoning, tell us your move.


Memorizing the moves:
1) Memorize the number of □ in the beginning state. This total number remains unchanged.
2) Memorize where you left your tokens on each turn.
3) If you add all of the □ and all of the tokens, you will see that the total number of fields is the same as in the beginning state.
4) The total number of fields remains the same as in the beginning state even if you add a new token to the board.
5) The total number of fields remains the same as in the beginning state even if all of the tokens are added to the board.

Counting fields:

1) The initial field on the board is counted as 1.
2) Fields are counted from left to right.
3) Position 0 means that the token is not on the board.
4) The current position of your token is always equal to your previous move. If your previous position was for example X -> 6, the current position of X must also be 6.
5) The number of fields does not change throughout the game! Please remember that. The total number of fields in the game will remain the same as in the initial state. Remember that number.
6) If you are at field N, and I rolled a number M, your next position will be equal to M+N.


Adding tokens:

1) Token can only be added when a 6 is rolled.
2) Token can only be added at position 1.
3) Maximum number of tokens on the field is 2.
4) If there are already 2 tokens on the field, no more tokens can be added.
5) You cannot add a token if I do not roll a 6.
6) If I roll a 6, and there is already 1 token on the board, you are allowed to add another one.


Movement:

1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board.
2) In the beginning of the game, you do not have any tokens on the board.
3) You can only move from left to right.
4) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die.
5) You need to move the same number of fields as given by the roll.
6) Fields are counted from left to right.
7) First field is counted as number 1.
7) Position 0 means that a token is not on the board, therefore it cannot be counted.
8) If there are 2 tokens on the board, think about which one to move. You want to finish the game in as few moves as possible.
9) You have to move if I roll a die, you cannot skip turns.
10) If there is already a token on the board and I roll a 6, you can move the token on the board or add the second token. You are free to make a decision.
11) If all of the tokens are already on board, and you roll a 6, you are allowed to move any of the tokens.
12) All of the other constraints apply at all times. Please consider them.
13) Once you move a token, the previously occupied field is marked with □.

Skipping moves:

1) You are not allowed to move a token if the rolled number + token position is higher than the total number of fields on the board.
2) If you cannot move any of the tokens, the turn is skipped.
Please note: you need to keep track of your current position, and move N (rolled number) positions from it. It is important that you do that.
3) If your token is at the final position on the board, you are not allowed to further move that token.

Ending the game:
1) To end the game, both of your tokens need to reach the last field on the grid.
2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields from a token, you cannot move that token.
3) If you cannot move any of the tokens, you must skip the turn.
3) You need at least 2 tokens to be on the board to finish the game. You cannot move your token on the board to the finish line if it's the only token on the board.

Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to memorize your position in the previous turn.
The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number.
Think through your every step.

Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step.


Q:
Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 0,  Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. There are no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token X on the board at field 1.
MY MOVE: X -> 1 ; Y -> 0


Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 5, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
We started with 23 fields. Currently, there are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. 23 = 23.  My token X is on field number 10 and token Y is not on the board. You have rolled 4. This is 4 fields away from my previous position. Since only token X is on the board, I can try to move token X. Since 10 + 4 = 14, I can move my token X to field number 14.
MY MOVE: X -> 14 ; Y -> 0


Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □
Next turn number: 7, Roll: 5. Where will you move your token?
A:
We started with 23 fields. Currently, there are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. 23 = 23. My token X is on field number 20 and token Y is not on the board. You have rolled 5. This is 5 fields away from my previous position. Since only token X is on the board, I can try to move token X. Since 20 + 5 = 25, and 25 > 23, I cannot move.
MY MOVE: X -> 20 ; Y -> 0


Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 8, Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
We started with 23 fields. Currently, there are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. 23 = 23. I have token X on field number 12. and Y is not on the board. You have rolled 6. Therefore, I can decide to move or put another token on the board.  I decide to put another token on the board. This allows me to place my token Y on the board at field 1.
MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 1

Here is another example.
Q:
Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 0,  Roll: 5. Where will you move your token?
A:
We started with 23 fields. Currently, there are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. 23 = 23. There are no tokens on the board. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board.
MY MOVE: X -> 0 ; Y -> 0

Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: Y □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 6, Roll: 3. Where will you move your token?
A:
We started with 23 fields. Currently, there are 22 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. 23 = 23. I have token X on field 12 and token Y on field 1. You have rolled 3. This is 3 fields away from my previous position. Since both tokens are on the field, I can try to move any of them. I decide to move my token Y. Since 1 + 3 = 4, I need to move my token to field number 4.
MY MOVE: X -> 12 ; Y -> 4

Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ Y □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □
Next turn number: 7, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
We started with 23 fields. Currently, there are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. 23 = 23. I have token X on field 22 and token Y on field 5. You have rolled 4. This is 4 fields away from my previous position. Since both tokens are on the field, I can try to move any of them. I decide to move my token X. Since 22 + 4 = 26, and 26 > 23, I cannot move token X. Therefore, I will move token Y. Since 5 + 4 = 9, I need to move token Y to field number 9.
MY MOVE: X -> 22 ; Y -> 9


Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ Y X □
Next turn number: 7, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
We started with 23 fields. Currently, there are 21 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. 23 = 23. I have token X on field 22 and token Y on field 21. You have rolled 4. This is 4 fields away from my previous position. Since both tokens are on the field, I can try to move any of them. I decide to move my token Y. Since 21 + 4 = 25, I cannot move token Y. Therefore, I will try token X. Since 22 + 4 = 26, and 26 > 23, I cannot move token X.
MY MOVE: X -> 22 ; Y -> 21



Now let's really play the game.
