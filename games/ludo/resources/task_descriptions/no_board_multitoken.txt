Welcome to ludogame! Your task is to move a from start to end across the board. I will give you a board with empty fields. An empty field is marked like this □.
Your token is marked with X. Your token X counts as an occupied field. The total number of fields remains unchanged throughout the game.


General instructions:
1) Every turn I will give you the current state of the grid. You must tell me what your next move is.
2) Your answers must contain the words "MY MOVE:", the instruction of how you want the token to move.
3) Make sure that you properly count the number of fields in the beginning state! The number of fields will remain unchanged until the end of the game.
4) You must keep track of your moves throughout the game. If you remember where your token is, you are less likely to make a mistake.
5) The token in the current position provided by me will always be where you left in your previous move.

Tokens:
1) You are entitled to three tokens in total, marked X1, X2, X3.
2) The goal is to get all three tokens to the final position on the board.
3) Unless it is the final position, two tokens are not allowed to be at the same position at the same time.


Movement:
1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board.
2) In the beginning of the game, you do not have any tokens on the board.
3) You are only allowed to add your token when I roll a 6. The token is placed on the 1st field on the board.
4) If a token is already occupying the first position on the board, you cannot add a new one.
5) If I do not roll a 6, your token cannot be added to the board.
6) You can only move from left to right.
7) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die.
8) You need to move the same number of fields as given by the roll.
9) You can only move one token each turn. Other tokens stay in place.
10) Once you move the token, the previously occupied field is marked with □.
11) Fields are counted from left to right.

Please note: you need to keep track of your current position, and move N (rolled number) positions from it. It is important that you do that.

Ending the game:
1) To end the game, all three tokens need to be at the last field on the grid.
2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move the token.

Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to memorize your position in the previous turn.
The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number.
Take a deap breath and think through your every step.

Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step.


Q:
Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 0,  Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 21 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 0 = 21 fields. There are no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token on the board at field 1.
MY MOVE: X1 -> 1 ; X2 -> 0 ; X3 -> 0


Here is another example from a different game.
Q:
Current state: □ □ X1 □ □ X3 □ □ □ X2 □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 5, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
There were 17 empty fields in the beginning state. Now, there are 14 empty fields and 3 occupied field. In total: 14 + 3 = 17 fields. My token is on field number 10. You have rolled 4. Since 10 + 4 = 14, I need to move my token to field number 14. This is 4 fields away from my previous position.
MY MOVE: X1 -> 3 ; X2 -> 14 ; X3 -> 6


Here is another example from a different game.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □
Next turn number: 7, Roll: 5. Where will you move your token?
A:
There were 23 empty fields in the beginning state. Now, there are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token is on field number 20. You have rolled 5. This is 5 fields away from my previous position. Since 20 + 5 = 25, and 25 > 23, I cannot move.
MY MOVE: X -> 20

Here is another example from a different game.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 8, Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There were 20 empty fields in the beginning state. Now, here are 19 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 19 + 1 = 20 fields. My token is on field number 12. You have rolled 6. My token is already on the board. Since 12 + 6 = 18, I need to move my token to field number 18.
MY MOVE: X -> 18

Here is another example from a different game.
Q:
Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 0,  Roll: 5. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 19 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 19 + 0 = 23 fields. There are no tokens on the board. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board.
MY MOVE: X -> 0



Now let's really play the game.
