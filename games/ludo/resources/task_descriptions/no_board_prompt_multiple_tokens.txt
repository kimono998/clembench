Welcome to ludogame! Your task is to move a from start to end across the board. I will give you a board with empty fields. An empty field is marked like this □.
Your tokens is marked with X and Y. You tokens X or Y counts as an occupied field. The total number of fields remains unchanged throughout the game.

General instructions:
1) Every turn I will give you the current state of the grid. You must tell me what your next move is.
2) Your answers must contain the words "MY MOVE:", the instruction of how you want the token to move.
3) You must keep track of the state of the board in order to win the game.
4) Add a second token when the second 6 is rolled for the first time in the game. After that, decide on which token you want to move each round.
5) You cannot have 2 tokens in the same field.
6) You can only play one token in 1 round.


Movement:
1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board.
2) In the beginning of the game, you do not have any tokens on the board.
3) You are only allowed to add your token when I roll a 6. The token is placed on the 1st field on the board.
4) If I do not roll a 6, your token cannot be added to the board.
5) You can only move from left to right.
6) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die.
7) You need to move the same number of fields as given by the roll.
8) Once you move a token, the previously occupied field is marked with □.
9) Fields are counted from left to right.
10) If there are 2 tokens on the board, choose which one to move strategically.
11) You have to move if I roll a die, you cannot skip turns.
12) If there is already a token on the board and I roll a 6, you can move the token on the board or add the second token. It's up to you.
Please note: you need to keep track of your current position, and move N (rolled number) positions from it. It is important that you do that.

Ending the game:
1) To end the game, you need to finish at the last field on the grid.
2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move.
3) You need at least 2 tokens to be on the board to finish the game. You cannot move your token on the board to the finish line if it's the only token on the board. 

Note: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game. You need to memorize your position in the previous turn.
The game begins when I give you the beginning state and roll the first number.
Think through your every step.

Here is an example of what one turn looks like. Let's think step by step.


Q:
Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 0,  Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. There are no tokens on the board. You have rolled a 6. This allows me to place my token on the board at field 1.
MY MOVE: X -> 1


Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 5, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token is on field number 10. You have rolled 4. Since 10 + 4 = 14, I need to move my token to field number 14. This is 4 fields away from my previous position.
MY MOVE: X -> 14


Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □
Next turn number: 7, Roll: 5. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token is on field number 20. You have rolled 5. This is 5 fields away from my previous position. Since 20 + 5 = 25, and 25 > 23, I cannot move.
MY MOVE: X -> 20


Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 8, Roll: 6. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 1 occupied field. In total: 22 + 1 = 23 fields. My token is on field number 12. You have rolled 6. I decide to put another token on the board.  This allows me to place my token on the board at field 1.
MY MOVE: Y -> 1

Here is another example.
Q:
Beginning state: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 0,  Roll: 5. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 23 empty fields and 0 occupied fields. In total: 23 + 0 = 23 fields. There are no tokens on the board. Since you have not rolled a 6, I cannot place a token on the board.
MY MOVE: X -> 0

Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: Y □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
Next turn number: 6, Roll: 3. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. I have token Y on field 1 and token X on field 12. You have rolled 3. I decide to move my token Y.  Since 1 + 3 = 4, I need to move my token to field number 4.
MY MOVE: Y -> 4

Here is another example.
Q:
Current state: □ □ □ □ Y □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ X □
Next turn number: 7, Roll: 4. Where will you move your token?
A:
There are 22 empty fields and 2 occupied fields. In total: 21 + 2 = 23 fields. I have token Y on field 5 and token X on field 22. You have rolled 5. This is 5 fields away from my previous position. Since 20 + 5 = 25, and 25 > 23, I cannot move token X. So I move token Y. Since 5 + 4 = 9, I need to move token Y to field number 9. 
MY MOVE: Y -> 9



Now let's really play the game.
