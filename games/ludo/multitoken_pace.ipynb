      "Your tokens are marked with X and Y. Your tokens X or Y count as occupied fields. The total number of fields remains unchanged throughout the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "General instructions:\n",
      "1) Every turn I will give you the current state of the grid. You must tell me what your next move is.\n",
      "2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", the instruction of how you want the token to move.\n",
      "3) You must keep track of the state of the board in order to win the game.\n",
      "4) You cannot have 2 tokens in the same field, except for in the end field. \n",
      "5) You can only play one token in 1 round.\n",
      "6) You can add a new token when 6 is rolled.\n",
      "7) If both tokens are on the board, no new tokens can be added.\n",
      "8) Once a token is on the board, it cannot be removed from the board. \n",
      "9) The number of fields does not change throughout the game! Please remember that. The total number of fields in the game will remain the same as in the initial state. Remember that number.\n",

      "Movement:\n",

      "3) You are only allowed to add a token when I roll a 6. The token is placed on the 1st field on the board.\n",
      "4) If I do not roll a 6, a token cannot be added to the board.\n",
      "5) You can only move from left to right.\n",
      "6) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die.\n",
      "7) You need to move the same number of fields as given by the roll.\n",
      "8) Once you move a token, the previously occupied field is marked with â–¡.\n",
      "9) Fields are counted from left to right.\n",
      "10) If there are 2 tokens on the board, think about which one to move. You want to finish the game in as few moves as possible.\n",
      "11) You have to move if I roll a die, you cannot skip turns.\n",
      "12) If there is already a token on the board and I roll a 6, you can move the token on the board or add the second token. You are free to make a decision.\n",
      "13) If all of the tokens are already on board, and you roll a 6, you are allowed to move any of the tokens.\n",

      "Ending the game:\n",
      "1) To end the game, both of your tokens need to be at the last field on the grid.\n",
      "2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields from a token, you cannot move that token.\n",
      "3) If you cannot move any of the tokens, you must skip the turn.\n",
