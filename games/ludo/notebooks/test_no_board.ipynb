You must tell me what your next move is.\\n2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", the instruction of how you want the token to move.\\n3) Make sure that you properly count the number of fields in the beginning state! The number of fields will remain unchanged until the end of the game.\\n4) You must keep track of your moves throughout the game. If you remember where your token is, you are less likely to make a mistake.\\n5) The token in the current position provided by me will always be where you left in your previous move.\\n\\n\\n\\nMovement:\\n1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board.\\n2) In the beginning of the game, you do not have any tokens on the board.\\n3) You are only allowed to add your token when I roll a 6. The token is placed on the 1st field on the board.\\n4) If I do not roll a 6, your token cannot be added to the board.\\n5) You can only move from left to right.\\n6) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die.\\n7) You need to move the same number of fields as given by the roll.\\n8) You only have one token. Once you move the token, the previously occupied field is marked with □.\\n9) Fields are counted from left to right.\\n\\nPlease note: you need to keep track of your current position, and move N (rolled number) positions from it. It is important that you do that.\\n\\nEnding the game:\\n1) To end the game, you need to finish at the last field on the grid.\\n2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move.\\n\\nNote: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game.
